# ⚙️ SPRINT 2 – JavaScript Basics

This project contains JavaScript exercises of varying difficulty levels.

## Description

The project consists of seven parts, each one designed to practice a different core concept in JavaScript:

1. **Arrow functions**  
2. **Ternary operators**  
3. **Callbacks**  
4. **Rest & Spread operators**  
5. **Array transformations**  
6. **Array loops**  
7. **Promises & Async/Await**

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the main branch `main`, which contains all completed exercises.

Each exercise part has its own branch. Inside each branch you’ll find:
- A basic HTML file to run and test the `.js` script
- A JavaScript file with the actual exercises
- An additional `.js` file to visually improve the HTML output

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edison-r/S1-Web-Evolution-Project.git

## My Dev Journal
Working through this sprint taught me how many of JavaScript’s “basic” tools are actually incredibly powerful.

I began the sprint feeling a bit overwhelmed by array methods and how functions interact with data. But as I moved forward, piece by piece, everything started to click — especially when I started seeing how things like `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `async/await` can bring logic to life.

Learning to break problems down into small, understandable parts helped me get past the hard sections. Whenever I felt stuck, I took a breath, revisited the fundamentals, and tackled one step at a time.

Now, looking back at all seven parts, I’m proud of how far I’ve come — not just in writing JavaScript, but in thinking like a developer. ⚡️
